## Introduction

-   We decided to explore Allen's rule: body surface-area-to-volume ratio for animals varies with the average temperature of a creature's habitat.

-   We used data on birds fount in the Atlantic Forest of South America to explore the connection between altitude and length to mass ratios

    ![lmr = -0.13, altitude = 1 1188 m](https://nas-national-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/Masked_Duck_KK_APA_2011_18324_145923_RonBielefeld.jpg "Masked Duck (Nomonyx dominicus)")

## Methods

-   Our data came from The Atlantic Bird's Data Set; a data set complied over decades by many scientists.

-   In bird data collection, birds are typically caught in a mist net

    ![](https://talesfromawanderingalbatross.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/mgwa-in-mist-net.jpg)

-   Then various measurements are taken. We are interested in the length to mass ratio

## Results

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#ggplot Length Mass Ratio vs Altitude
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    y = length_mass_ratio, 
    x = altitude)) +
  labs(x = "Altitude",
       y = "Length:Mass")+
  theme_gray(base_size = 24) +
ggsave("lmratio_altitude_scatter.png", units="in", height=8, width=12, dpi = 300)
```

Figure 1. We ran our mass to length ratio with altitude and found we had very messy data

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, warning=FALSE}
#testing for normal distribution of length_mass_ratio
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = length_mass_ratio), bins = 50, boundary = 0)
```

```{r}
#seperate by order
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = length_mass_ratio), bins = 50, boundary = 0) +
  facet_wrap(~Order, ncol = 5)
```

-   Here we noticed that our data were severely right skewed

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#log of length_mass_ratio to correct right skew 
length_vs_mass <-mutate(length_vs_mass, ln_lmr = log(length_mass_ratio))

#testing for normal distribution of ln_lmr
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = ln_lmr), bins = 100)+ 
  facet_wrap(~Order)
```

-   We corrected the skew in our data by transforming it by taking the natural log of our data points

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(
    Order=="Passeriformes",
    Family=="Furnariidae",
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(
    Order=="Passeriformes",
    Family=="Furnariidae",
    altitude > 1000
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

-   We plotted the mean lmr for each genus/species and saw a slight upward trend which intensified when we looked exclusivly at altitudes higher than 1000

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
    passeriformes_means<-
      length_vs_mass %>% 
      filter(!is.na(altitude), !is.na(ln_lmr)) %>% 
      group_by(Order, Family, Genus, Species) %>% 
      summarize(
        ln_lmr = mean(ln_lmr),
        altitude = mean(altitude)
      )  
    mean_hilo <-
      passeriformes_means %>% 
      mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>% 
      group_by(hilo) %>% 
      summarize(
        mean = mean(ln_lmr),
        # sd = sd(ln_lmr, na.rm = TRUE),
        # sem = sd(ln_lmr)/sqrt(n()),
        # upper = ln_lmr + 2*sem,
        # lower = ln_lmr - 2*sem
      )

    passeriformes_means %>% 
      mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = ln_lmr)) +
      geom_histogram() +
      geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean), data = mean_hilo,
                 linetype = "dashed", size = 2, color = "red") +
      facet_wrap(~ hilo, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")

    ```

-   We took the mean lmr of birds found over 1000 m and birds found under 1000 and found the means were different

    ```{r, include=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
    passeriformes_means %>% 
      mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>% 
      t.test(ln_lmr ~ hilo, data = .)
    #antilog of hi
    exp(2.067247)

    #antilog of low
    exp(1.647261)
    ```

-   The mean lmr of birds found above 1000 m = 7.9 while the mean lmr of birds found below 1000 m = 5.2. A Welch's Two Sample t-test found t(76) = 3.6, p =0.0005.

## Discussion

-   Our analysis suggests that the greater the altitude a bird species is found at, the greater their mean lmr is.

-   This trend follows the trend seen in birds examined latitudinally as seen in many other research projects on birds.

-   Essentially, what we see is that birds that are fat and fluffy tend to live at higher elevations that birds that are long and skinny.

-   A possible explination for this is that birds that found in more extreme climates (higher elevations) are more adapted for their specific environment.

-   Allen's rule suggest that any morphological trait (such as appendage thickness or hair length) should also vary based on temperature. A future analysis we would like to do is see if this trend holds true for other morphological bird characteristics.
