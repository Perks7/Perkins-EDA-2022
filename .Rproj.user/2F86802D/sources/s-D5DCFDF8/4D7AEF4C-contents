# **Morphological Analysis of Birds in the Atlantic Forest of South America**

Casey Perkins, Bryn Rivenes

## Introduction

-   **Allen's Rule**: body surface area to volume ratio for animals varies with the average temperature of a creature's habitat (Allen A, 1877)​

-   The lower the surface area, the less heat can escape, so animals at higher altitudes should have less surface area and a higher body mass​

-   However, some studies have shown this rule to be inaccurate (Alho J, et al. 2010)​

-   We set out to test **Allen's Rule** using an existing data set of bird morphological traits

    ![lmr = -0.13, altitude = 1 1188 m](https://nas-national-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/Masked_Duck_KK_APA_2011_18324_145923_RonBielefeld.jpg "Masked Duck (Nomonyx dominicus)")

## Methods

-   Our data came from **The Atlantic Bird's Data Set**; a data set of bird morphological traits and locations complied over decades by many scientists through museum collections, online data bases, published sources, and unpublished reports for data analysis (Hasui E, et al. 2017)​

-   It includes data from **72,483 individual birds** and **780 species**​

-   The Atlantic Forest is located mostly on the East coast of Brazil, with some of it stretching into Argentina and Paraguay​

-   We use the length to mass ratio as a proxy for body surface-area-to-volume ratio

-   **discuss/cite R and pkgs**

## Results

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#ggplot Length Mass Ratio vs Altitude
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    y = length_mass_ratio, 
    x = altitude)) +
  labs(x = "Altitude",
       y = "Length:Mass")+
  theme_gray(base_size = 24) +
ggsave("lmratio_altitude_scatter.png", units="in", height=8, width=12, dpi = 300)
```

Figure 1. We ran our mass to length ratio with altitude and found we had very messy data

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, warning=FALSE}
#testing for normal distribution of length_mass_ratio
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = length_mass_ratio), bins = 50, boundary = 0)
```

```{r}
#seperate by order
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = length_mass_ratio), bins = 50, boundary = 0) +
  facet_wrap(~Order, ncol = 5)
```

-   Here we noticed that our data were severely right skewed

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#log of length_mass_ratio to correct right skew 
length_vs_mass <-mutate(length_vs_mass, ln_lmr = log(length_mass_ratio))

#testing for normal distribution of ln_lmr
ggplot(data = length_vs_mass) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = ln_lmr), bins = 100)+ 
  facet_wrap(~Order)
```

-   We corrected the skew in our data by transforming it by taking the natural log of our data points

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(
    Order=="Passeriformes",
    Family=="Furnariidae",
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

length_vs_mass %>% 
  filter(
    Order=="Passeriformes",
    Family=="Furnariidae",
    altitude > 1000
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

-   We plotted the mean lmr for each genus/species and saw a slight upward trend which intensified when we looked exclusivly at altitudes higher than 1000

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
    passeriformes_means<-
      length_vs_mass %>% 
      filter(!is.na(altitude), !is.na(ln_lmr)) %>% 
      group_by(Order, Family, Genus, Species) %>% 
      summarize(
        ln_lmr = mean(ln_lmr),
        altitude = mean(altitude)
      )  
    mean_hilo <-
      passeriformes_means %>% 
      mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>% 
      group_by(hilo) %>% 
      summarize(
        mean = mean(ln_lmr),
        # sd = sd(ln_lmr, na.rm = TRUE),
        # sem = sd(ln_lmr)/sqrt(n()),
        # upper = ln_lmr + 2*sem,
        # lower = ln_lmr - 2*sem
      )

    passeriformes_means %>% 
      mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = ln_lmr)) +
      geom_histogram() +
      geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean), data = mean_hilo,
                 linetype = "dashed", size = 2, color = "red") +
      facet_wrap(~ hilo, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")

    ```

-   We took the mean lmr of birds found over 1000 m and birds found under 1000 and found the means were different

    ```{r, include=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
    passeriformes_means %>% 
      mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>% 
      t.test(ln_lmr ~ hilo, data = .)
    #antilog of hi
    exp(2.067247)

    #antilog of low
    exp(1.647261)
    ```

-   The mean lmr of birds found above 1000 m = 7.9 while the mean lmr of birds found below 1000 m = 5.2. A Welch's Two Sample t-test found t(76) = 3.6, p =0.0005.

-   **Text describing what we did and what it means then back up with figure/graph**

-   **add figure legends to each graph (Fig. 1)**

## Discussion

-   We predicted length mass ratio would decrease with elevation however, our analysis and t-test show an increase in length mass ratio with increased elevation​

-   This is the exact **opposite** of what we would **e**xpect to see according to **Allen's Rule** ​

-   Other studies have found similar results that contradict **Allen's Rule** and suggest that the body surface area to volume ratio has a genetic basis rather than an environmental one (Alho J, et al. 2010)

-   **Restate findings briefly**

-   **talk about what is MEANS**

-   **talk about what we could do with these findings in the future/future experiments**
