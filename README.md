## Morphological Analysis of Birds in the Atlantic Forest of South America

##### Casey Perkins and Bryn Rivenes

Abstract-- Allen's rule states that body surface-area-to-volume ratio for animals gets smaller in colder climates. We set out to test this rule using altitude and ratio of mass to length of Passeriformes found in The Atlantic Forest from the Atlantic Bird Traits data set. After transforming our length to mass ratio using the ln log, we found that there was a positive correlation between the length to mass ratio and altitude. Based on other similar analyses, we expected to see a positive correlation between these variables. Curious if this was a result of coupling species together, we separated out genus *Turdus*, but we found the same positive correlation. Other studies have found similar results that contradict Allen's Rule and suggest that the body surface area to volume ratio hasÂ a genetic basis rather than an environmental one. In a future study, we would like to look at exclusivley non-migratory birds. This would be a control for birds who live at higher altitudes in warmer months and migrate in cooler months, and consequently would not need to have a low length to mass ratio because of their migration patterns.
