# **Morphological Analysis of Birds in the Atlantic Forest of South America**

## Introduction

-   Allen's Rule states that body surface area to volume ratio for animals varies with the average temperature of a creature's habitat (Allen A, 1877)​. This rule is based on the idea that an animal in a colder habitat should have a lower surface area so that they do not lose as much heat. Conversely, animals in warmer climates should have larger surface areas to allow more heat to escape.

-   There are several studies that give evidence for the validity of Allen's Rule. This study showed the major impacts that the environment had on body mass and wing length of birds. They found larger birds were found at higher altitudes (Sun Y, *et al.,* 2022). Other studies show that body weight increases with altitude (Landmann A and Winding N, 1995)(Blackburn T and Ruggiero A, 2001).

-   However, there are are also studies that give evidence against Allen's Rule. In one study, it was found that frogs actually had larger surface areas in colder temperatures. The authors suggested there may be a more substantial genetic influence rather than a environment influence (Alho J, et al. 2010).

-   We set out to test Allen's Rule using an existing data set of bird morphological traits called the Atlantic Birds data set.

## Methods

-   The Atlantic Birds data set was complied over decades by many scientists through museum collections, online data bases, published sources, and unpublished reports for data analysis (Hasui E, et al. 2017)​.

-   The Atlantic Forest is located on the East coast of Brazil and it stretches into Argentina and Paraguay​. This area has significant changes in altitude which we used as our temperature variable.

-   We used the length to mass ratio as a proxy for body surface-area-to-volume ratio.

-   We used RStudio to compute our data (RStudio Team, 2019). In addition, we used R packages tidyverse (Wickham *et al*., 2019), ggplot2 (Wickham H, 2016) and ggrepel (Slowikowski *et al.*, 2021).

## Results

We begin with plotting our entire data set. The data displays a severe right skew.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# testing for normal distribution of lm_ratio
ggplot(data = bird_data) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = lm_ratio), 
    bins = 50, 
    boundary = 0) +
  labs(x = "Length Mass Ratio",
       y = "Number of Birds") 

```

###### Fig. 1: Histogram of the length mass ratio of birds in the data set

To correct for the skew, we transform the data using the natural log of each data point and graph the data again. We observe a hump on the left side of the data.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, warning=FALSE}
#log of lm_ratio to correct right skew 
bird_data <- mutate(bird_data, ln_lmr = log(lm_ratio))
bird_data_cut <- mutate(bird_data, ln_lmr = log(lm_ratio))

#testing for normal distribution of ln_ratio

ggplot(data = bird_data) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = ln_lmr), 
    bins = 100) +
  labs(x = "ln of Length Mass Ratio",
       y = "Number of Birds")
```

###### Fig. 2: Histogram of the natural log of length mass ratio of birds in the data set

To find the source of the hump, we break out each order into it's own graph. From this graph, we can see that the hump is cause by order Anseriformes (ducks). This makes sense as ducks should have a much smaller length to mass ratio than the majority of birds in the data set. The order that makes up the most of the data set appears to be order Passeriformes (songbirds). In addition, this order appears to have a normal distribution and relatively similar birds. This makes order Passeriformes a good test subject for Allen's Rule.

```{r}
#testing for normal distribution of lm_ratio by order

ggplot(data = bird_data) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(
    x = ln_lmr), bins = 100) + 
  facet_wrap(~order,scales = "free_y") +
  labs(y = "Number of Birds",
       x = "ln of Length Mass Ratio")
```

###### Fig. 3: Histogram of the natural log of length to mass ratio of individual bird orders in the data set

Here we are looking for any trends in the length mass ratio vs altitude of Passeriformes, and we find there is a slight upward trend in the regression line that becomes more pronounced as altitude increases.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#ln_lmr vs altitude for Passeriformes with regression line

bird_data %>% 
  filter(order=="Passeriformes") %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  labs(y = "ln Length Mass Ratio",
       x = "Altitude")+
  theme(strip.text = element_text(size = rel(.7)))
```

###### Fig. 4: Scatter plot of order the ln length mass ratio of Passeriformes vs altitude

Here we find a relatively normal distribution of mean ln length mass ratio for each species in order Passeriformes.

```{r}
# frequency distribution of mean ln_lmr in passeriformes

bird_data %>% 
  filter(order == "Passeriformes")%>% 
  group_by(order, family, genus, species) %>% 
  summarize(ln_lmr = mean(ln_lmr),
            altitude = mean(altitude)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = ln_lmr)) +
  labs(y = "Mean Species Length Mass Ratio",
       x = "ln Length Mass Ratio")

```

###### Fig. 5: Histogram of mean species ln length mass ratio for order Passeriformes

When we run the mean of each species against altitude and add a regression line, we find that there is a positive correlation.

```{r}
#mean of ln_lmr for species vs altitude

bird_data %>% 
  group_by(order, family, genus, species) %>% 
  summarize(ln_lmr = mean(ln_lmr),
            altitude = mean(altitude)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(y = "ln Length Mass Ratio",
       x = "Altitude")
```

###### Fig. 6: Scatter plot of mean species ln length mass ratio for order Passeriformes with regression line. Error is represented by transparent area

To get a better look at the trend, we look at birds found only above 1000 meters and color code them by family. They receive a label only if they are found over 2000 meters. We notice six families that appear over 2000 meters.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#fit line with altitude > 1000 Passeriformes by family

bird_data %>% 
  filter(order=="Passeriformes",
         altitude >= 1000) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = family)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  geom_text_repel(
    mapping = aes(label = family), 
    data = bird_data %>% 
      filter(order=="Passeriformes",
             altitude >= 2000)) +
  labs(y = "ln Length Mass Ratio",
       x = "Altitude")
```

###### Fig. 7: Scatter plot of order Passeriformes ln length mass ratio vs altitude over 1000 meters colored by family

Perhaps this trend is a result of including too many genra together. We separate out genus *Turdus* to see if this has an effect on the regression line. While we find that there is a slight downward trend in some of the species means for genus *Turdus* (Fig. 9), we do not see this trend when we look at the individuals within the genus.

```{r}

#mean of ln_lmr vs altitude for genus Turdus

bird_data %>% 
  filter(genus == "Turdus") %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude,
    color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  xlim(c(0,1700)) +
  labs(y = "ln Length Mass Ratio",
       x = "Altitude")

```

###### Fig. 8: Scatter plot of ln length to mass ratio vs altitude by species for genus *Turdus*

When we take the mean ln length to mass ratio of each species in genus *Turdus*, we do find a slight downward trend with one outlying species, nigreceps.

```{r}
#mean ln_lmr by species vs altitude genus Turdus

bird_data %>% 
  filter(genus == "Turdus") %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(ln_lmr = mean(lm_ratio, na.rm=TRUE),
            altitude = mean(altitude, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species), size=5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Genus Turdus",
       y = "Mean Species ln Length Mass Ratio",
       x = "Altitude")
```

###### Fig. 9: Scatter plot of mean ln length to mass ratio vs altitude for all species in genus *Turdus*

Genus *Turdus* contains many migratory species. This could potentially have a drastic effect on the length to mass ratio of a bird. We might expect a sharper downward trend in length to mass ratio within one species that is non-migratory. This is because we cannot know if a migratory bird's body is fitted to it's colder environment or warmer environment. However, even when separating out non-migratory species flavipes, we see only an upward trend.

```{r}
#mean of ln_lmr vs altitude for genus Turdus: flavipes 

bird_data %>% 
  filter(species == "flavipes") %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    y = ln_lmr, 
    x = altitude,
    color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  xlim(c(0,1700)) +
  labs(y = "ln Length Mass Ratio",
       x = "Altitude")
```

###### Fig. 10: Scatter plot of species flavipes vs altitude with regression line

While there does not appear to be any significant trends in this individual genus, we do see significant differences in the mean length mass ratio for each species of order Passeriformes. However, we see the opposite trend that Allen's Rule would predict.

```{r}
# mean of passeriformes found over and under 1000 m

passeriformes_means %>% 
  mutate(hilo = ifelse(altitude>1000, "Above 1000 m", "Below 1000 m")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ln_lmr)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean), data = mean_hilo,
             linetype = "dashed", size = 2, color = "red") +
  facet_wrap(~ hilo, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") +
  labs( title = "Passeriformes", 
        x = "Mean ln Length Mass Ratio",
        y = "Number of Means")
```

###### Fig. 11: Histogram of the mean ln length to mass ratio for order Passeriformes divided into those found over and under 1000 meters

The mean lmr of birds found above 1000 m = 7.9 while the mean lmr of birds found below 1000 m = 5.2. A Welch's Two Sample t-test found these results to be significant t(76) = 3.6, p =0.0005.

## Discussion

-   We predicted length mass ratio would decrease with elevation however, our analysis and t-test show an increase in length mass ratio with increased elevation​. Even when separating out an individual species, there was no trend towards fatter, fluffier birds in colder climates. This is the exact opposite of what we would expect to see according to Allen's Rule.

-   Other studies have found similar results that contradict Allen's Rule and suggest that the body surface area to volume ratio has a genetic basis rather than an environmental one (Alho J, et al. 2010). For the birds in the Atlantic Forest, this would mean that their length to mass ratio is more depended on their individual genetic makeup rather than the climate they live in.

-   While we did not find any evidence of Allen's Rule playing out among order Passeriforms as a whole or genus Turdus, there may be other factors clouding our data. In a future study, we would like to look at exclusively non-migratory birds. This would be a control for birds who live at higher altitudes in warmer months and migrate in cooler months, and consequently would not need to have a low length to mass ratio because of their migration patterns, but they would cause the mean length to mass ratio of a genus to show an upward trend.
